Ollama is a novel approach to machine learning that enables users to run large language models (LLMs) locally on their devices. Learn how Ollama works, its features, applications, and ethical considerations. Ollama lets you run and customize large language models (LLMs) on your computer without cloud reliance or complex setups. Learn what Ollama is, how it works, and what it's used for in various AI projects and domains. Ollama with DeepSeek-R1 represents a significant step toward democratizing AI by putting powerful language models directly in developers' hands. Ollama is an open-source tool that lets you run large language models (LLMs) on your local machine. Key features, supported models, and use cases for AI developers. Ollama now supports tool calling with popular models like Llama 3.1 allowing models to answer prompts using known tools.

Large language models (LLMs) are advanced AI systems trained on vast amounts of text to understand and generate human-like language. They use deep neural network architectures with billions of parameters to predict and compose text in a coherent, context-aware manner. LLMs have applications in natural language processing, generative tasks, conversational AI, code generation, and more. Examples of popular LLMs include GPT, BERT, RoBERTa, T5, and others. These models have been pivotal in various industries such as customer service, healthcare, education, legal, and more.

{"topic":"MCP in LLMs","summary":"Anthropic launched the Model Context Protocol (MCP) in November 2024 as an open standard for data exchange between LLMs and various data sources. The protocol provides a simplified way for LLMs to connect with data sources and tools, enabling the creation of complex workflows and agents on top of LLMs. MCP is a plugin system for LLMs, enhancing their capabilities by connecting them to different data sources and tools. It is designed to standardize how applications provide context to AI models, particularly LLMs, making it easier for LLMs to access and interact with external information.","sources":["Wikipedia","Search"],"tools_used":["functions.wikipedia","functions.search"]}
